# tutorials
tutorials made with PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge tool
## NOTE!
This is not official tutorials. this is tutorials made by agentic ai that scans through a git repository and 
make up in its own manner how it is going to present the repo. My guess is that there can and probably will 
be alot of miss information in various concepts. so have that in mind when reading through.

And as always, have fun! :D
